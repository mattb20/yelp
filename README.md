# README

A clone of the website Yelp built using Rails, fully test driven

MVP:
- Visitors can create new restaurants using a form, specifying a name and description
- Restaurants can be edited and deleted
- Visitors can leave reviews for restaurants, providing a numerical score (1-5) and a comment about their experience
- The restaurants listings page should display all the reviews, along with the average rating of each restaurant
- Validations should be in place for the restaurant and review forms - restaurants must be given a name and rating, reviews must be given a rating from 1-5 (comment is optional)

* Use Ruby 2.5.0

* To test run rspec from command line
